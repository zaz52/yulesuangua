## Try It Now (Browser-First)

> **Most users don't need to install anything.** Buddhist students, researchers, and curious readers can use every master directly in a web browser.

### 👉 [Open fojin.app/chat](https://fojin.app/chat)

On the AI Q&A page, open the **"法师模式"** (Master Mode) dropdown in the bottom-left and pick one of the 8 pre-built masters to start chatting.

- No install, no signup
- `/compare-masters` multi-master comparison works the same way
- Live citation retrieval backed by FoJin's 503 sources and 678K+ semantic embeddings
- Every answer carries a CBETA source ID

**Not sure which master to ask?** Start here:

| Your situation | Suggested master |
|---|---|
| "My mind is scattered, I can't sit still" | `/xuyun` `/zhiyi` (huatou / śamatha-vipaśyanā) |
| "I can't follow the logic of the sutras" | `/xuanzang` (Yogācāra precision) |
| "I've studied for years but feel stuck" | `/yinguang` (plain, sincere nianfo) |
| "I want to understand emptiness" | `/kumarajiva` `/huineng` (Madhyamaka / direct pointing) |
| "I want a systematic view of Huayan / Tiantai" | `/fazang` `/zhiyi` (classification and metaphysics) |
| "I'm torn between Chan and Pure Land" | `/ouyi` (cross-tradition synthesis) |

> Developers and Claude Code / Cursor users should skip to [Developer Installation](#developer-installation) to use the masters as terminal AgentSkills.

---

> **v0.3 Update**: Full architecture rebuild — CBETA provenance in frontmatter, offline source passages (`sources/`), automated fidelity tests (`fidelity.jsonl`), one-command NPX installer, and offline toolchain (`cite.py` / `query.py`).
>
> **Post-v0.3 iterations**: `/create-master` pipeline now enforces a two-stage independent review (doctrinal accuracy → voice consistency), HARD-GATE rules (no CBETA citation → no write), multi-platform plugin support across Claude Code / Cursor / Codex / OpenCode / Gemini CLI, a session-start hook that auto-injects the master list, plus pressure tests and CI validation for all 8 prebuilt masters.

## Seriousness Statement

This project is built out of respect for Buddhist traditions. All content is generated faithfully from historical documents. It makes no doctrinal judgments and claims no sectarian authority. Generated content is intended for study and reference only. For formal practice guidance, please seek out a qualified master and rely on genuine, living instruction.

---

## Features

- **8 pre-built Chinese Buddhist masters**: across Yogacara, Madhyamaka, Chan, Tiantai, Huayan, Pure Land, and cross-tradition — ready to use out of the box
- **Provenance enforcement**: Every master ships with CBETA IDs and FoJin text IDs in frontmatter; every doctrinal claim must carry a scriptural citation
- **Offline source passages**: `sources/` captures key passages from each master's core canon, so citations still work when FoJin is unreachable
- **Progressive disclosure**: SKILL.md is a decision tree + quick reference; `references/` and `sources/` are loaded on demand to keep context lean
- **HARD-GATE discipline**: Both `/create-master` and every prebuilt master embed hard rules — no unverified CBETA ID, no uncited doctrinal claim, no fictional personas
- **Two-stage independent review**: The generation pipeline forces a "doctrinal accuracy → voice consistency" review before write; FAIL triggers up to 2 rounds of automatic repair
- **Automated fidelity tests**: Each master's `tests/fidelity.jsonl` holds 5+ Q&A samples validating citations and keyword coverage; CI runs a dry-run on every push
- **Unified multi-platform plugin**: Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, OpenCode, and Gemini CLI share one `prebuilt/` tree, with a session-start hook injecting the master list on every platform
- **NPX one-shot install**: `npx master-skill install zhiyi` drops skills straight into Claude Code
- **Offline toolchain**: `scripts/cite.py` (CBETA lookup), `scripts/query.py` (offline semantic search), `scripts/validate.py` (frontmatter linter)
- **FoJin data bridge**: Connected to [fojin.app](https://fojin.app) with 503 data sources, 10K+ texts, 678K+ semantic embeddings, and a 31K-entity knowledge graph
- **AgentSkills standard**: Compliant with [Anthropic Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) — progressive disclosure, decision trees, black-box script pattern

## Developer Installation

> 👤 **Just want to try it?** Use [fojin.app/chat](https://fojin.app/chat) in your browser and skip this section entirely.
> 🛠️ **This section is for**: Claude Code / Cursor / Codex CLI / OpenCode / Gemini CLI users who want to invoke `/xuanzang`, `/huineng`, etc. directly as terminal AgentSkills.

### Installation

**NPX (recommended)**

```bash
npx master-skill install --all    # Install all 8 masters
npx master-skill list             # List available masters
```

**Claude Code**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xr843/Master-skill ~/Master-skill
cd ~/Master-skill && pip install -r requirements.txt
for d in prebuilt/*/; do ln -sf "$(pwd)/$d" ~/.claude/skills/"$(basename $d)"; done
ln -sf "$(pwd)" ~/.claude/skills/create-master
```

**Cursor** — Clone the repo; Cursor auto-detects `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`.

**OpenCode** — Add to `opencode.json`:

```json
{"plugin": ["master-skill@git+https://github.com/xr843/Master-skill.git"]}
```

**Codex CLI** — See [.codex/INSTALL.md](.codex/INSTALL.md)

**Gemini CLI** — Auto-discovered via `gemini-extension.json` and `GEMINI.md`.

### Use a Pre-built Master

In any AgentSkills-compatible environment (Claude Code / Cursor / Codex CLI / OpenCode / Gemini CLI):

```
/xuanzang       — Master Xuanzang (Yogacara)
/kumarajiva     — Kumarajiva (Madhyamaka / Sanlun)
/huineng        — Master Huineng (Chan, Sixth Patriarch)
/zhiyi          — Master Zhiyi (Tiantai)
/fazang         — Master Fazang (Huayan)
/yinguang       — Master Yinguang (Pure Land)
/ouyi           — Master Ouyi (Tiantai / Pure Land, cross-tradition)
/xuyun          — Master Xuyun (Chan, Five Houses)
```

### Compare Masters

Ask the same question to 2-3 masters in parallel and surface the differences between traditions:

```
# Auto-pick relevant masters
/compare-masters what is emptiness

# Manually pick masters (recommended for precise results)
/compare-masters how to read the Heart Sutra --masters xuanzang,huineng,zhiyi

# Natural-language triggers
compare Huineng and Yinguang on nianfo
how do Chan and Pure Land differ on practice
```

**Selection logic**: the command first tries to extract keywords from the question and match them against each master's core concepts; if nothing matches strongly, it falls back to topic mapping (nianfo / meditation / Yogacara-Madhyamaka / classification, etc.). **If the auto-pick feels off, use `--masters` to override.**

### Generate a Custom Master

```
/create-master Hongyi
```

Or use natural language:

```
Create a persona for Master Hongyi
```

The system will guide you through a three-step intake, then automatically collect data from FoJin and generate the doctrinal analysis and style files.

## Relationship to FoJin

[FoJin](https://fojin.app) is a Buddhist text aggregation platform integrating 503 data sources, 10K+ texts, 678K+ semantic vector embeddings, and a knowledge graph of 31K entities. It covers major corpora including CBETA Chinese Buddhist Canon, SuttaCentral Pali Canon and translations, and 84000 Tibetan Buddhist translations.

Master-skill connects to the FoJin API via `tools/fojin_bridge.py` to enable:

- Knowledge graph entity retrieval (master biography, lineage, school)
- Semantic similarity search (doctrinally relevant sutras)
- Runtime RAG retrieval for grounding answers in real texts
- Source passage extraction with provenance tracking

All citations include traceable FoJin links to ensure transparency of sources.

---

## Sensitivity Boundaries

**Will not:**

- Pass judgment on the relative merits of different schools or traditions
- Provide personal practice diagnoses (karma readings, past lives, etc.)
- Claim supernatural powers or auspicious experiences
- Engage with politically charged religious topics
- Offer medical advice

**Will:**

- Cite source texts faithfully, with FoJin links on every response
- Retrieve real texts via runtime RAG, not relying solely on AI training data
- Acknowledge clearly when a question falls outside scope
- Encourage users to seek out qualified masters and authentic practice

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Does it still work when the FoJin API is unreachable?**

Yes. Each prebuilt master ships with `prebuilt/<name>/sources/` — key passages from that master's core canon, stored offline. When FoJin is down, the master degrades to offline mode and declares "currently running on offline passages" in the reply. The `/create-master` pipeline asks the user to switch to manual-input mode when the API fails, so you can paste source text and continue.

**Q: What does a valid CBETA citation look like, and how is it verified?**

Every CBETA citation must carry a `Txxn####` identifier (for example, the Lotus Sutra is `T9n262`). `scripts/validate.py` lints the frontmatter `sources` block; `tools/verify_sources.py` checks every FoJin `text_id` against the live API before writing. Broken links are downgraded to FoJin search URLs — no dead references make it into the final file.

**Q: `npx master-skill install` fails with ENOTEMPTY or a permission error — what now?**

Clean up any leftover `~/.claude/skills/master-<name>/` directories before retrying. For npm-cache weirdness, run `npm cache clean --force` and rerun NPX. Windows users should execute from Git Bash or WSL to avoid cmd.exe path-escaping issues.

**Q: The generated master says things that don't match the historical record — how do I correct it?**

Just tell the master in-chat: "he wouldn't phrase it like that" or "he should sound more stern." The `/create-master` correction mode classifies the fix (doctrinal → appended to `teaching.md`; stylistic → appended to `voice.md`), writes it as a `## Correction` block with timestamp, and bumps the patch version. Correction blocks take priority over analysis-generated content at runtime.

**Q: How do I contribute a new prebuilt master?**

See "Contributing" below. The short version: follow the v0.3 layout under `prebuilt/<name>/`, pass `scripts/validate.py --strict` with zero errors, ship at least 5 fidelity Q&A samples in `tests/fidelity.jsonl`, then open a PR.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome: new prebuilt masters, corrections to source attributions, offline passage additions, or toolchain improvements.

New masters must follow the v0.3 layout: `prebuilt/<name>/` containing SKILL.md (with provenance frontmatter and a decision tree), `references/teaching.md` and `references/voice.md` (loaded on demand), `sources/*.md` (offline CBETA passages), and `tests/fidelity.jsonl` (5+ Q&A fidelity samples). Run `python3 scripts/validate.py --strict` for zero errors, and make sure the CI fidelity dry-run passes before opening a PR.

Before submitting, verify that sources trace back to CBETA, content is faithful to historical documents, and no sectarian bias is introduced.
